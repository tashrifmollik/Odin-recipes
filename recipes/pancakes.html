    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Flour:</b> This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose
        flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Baking powder:</b> Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy
        pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sugar:</b> Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for
        subtly sweet pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Salt:</b> A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without
        making your pancakes taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Milk and butter:</b> Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the
        pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Egg:</b> A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind
        the pancake batter together.
      </li>
    </ul>
