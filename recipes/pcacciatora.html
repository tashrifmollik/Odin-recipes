    <p>
      Pollo or Chicken Cacciatore is such a classic, rustic and comforting
      Italian stew. Made with juicy chicken thighs in a beautiful tomato sauce
      flavoured with hearty vegetables, herbs, pancetta and olives. Comfort food
      doesn't get much better than this, serve with creamy polenta or Italian
      roast potatoes.

      <li>7 oz (200g) Roma tomatoes, halved</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a heavy cast iron skillet. Sear chicken on
        both sides until golden, about 3-4 minutes each side. Remove from
        skillet and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add remaining oil to the pan. Sauté the onion until transparent, about
        3-4 minutes. Add in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30
        seconds. Add the peppers, carrot, mushrooms and herbs; cook for 5
        minutes until vegetables begin to soften.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the wine, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the
        skillet. Cook until wine is reduced, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, Roma tomatoes and chill flakes.
        Season with salt and pepper to your tastes. Return chicken pieces to the
        skillet and continue to cook over stove top
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix all of the ingredients together; cover with lid, reduce heat to low
        and allow to simmer (while stirring occasionally) for 40 minutes or
        until the meat is falling off the bone. Add in the olives, allow to
        simmer for a further 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve
        immediately.
